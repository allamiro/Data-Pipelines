## What is NiFi

Apache NiFi (NiFi stands for "Niagara Files") is an open-source software project that provides a way to automate the flow of data between systems. NiFi enables users to design data flows graphically through a web-based interface. These data flows can include a wide variety of data sources, transformations, and destinations.
